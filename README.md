✨ Python Coding Task – String Reversal 🐍

Today, I explored a simple yet powerful concept in Python: reversing a string.

💡 Why is this important?
String manipulation is one of the most common tasks in programming. Whether it’s checking for palindromes, formatting data, or solving interview questions, knowing how to reverse a string efficiently is super useful.

🔹 Code Explanation:

We created a function reverse_string()

Used Python’s slicing technique [::-1]

Returned the reversed string in just one line 🚀

🔹 Example:
Input → "hello"
Output → "olleh"

This task highlights how Python makes coding elegant and concise, allowing developers to solve problems with minimal effort.

I’ll keep sharing more Python problem-solving tasks to strengthen fundamentals and inspire others to practice consistently. 🌱
